This is develop branch, (Now a feature branch)

Every code (bug fix, feature etc) has to be first merged to this branch via PR.


Example:

A developer wrote some code and wants to push it to central repo then following are the steps to follow.

1. A feature branch should be created from develop.  git checkout develop, git branch -b feature/someX
2. A PR should be raised towards develop from the feature branch.
3. PR should be merged as per agreed process among developers.
